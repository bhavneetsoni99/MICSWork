% Problem 1
%          Information provided is as follows
A = [10 -3; 4 2];
B = [1 0; -1 2];
v = [1; 2];
w = [1; 1];
% a) v'w
vT = v'; % vT is the transpose of marice v
vTw=vT*w % Solution to Problem 1 Part a)

vTw =

     3

%b) vw'
wT = w'; % wT is the transpose of matrice w
vwT = v * wT % Solution to Problem 1 Part b)

vwT =

     1     1
     2     2

% c) Av
Av = A*v % Av is the product of A and v Solution to problem 1 Part c

Av =

     4
     8

% d) A'v
AT = A'; % AT is the transpose of A
ATv = AT * v % ATv is the the product of A' and v Solution to part d

ATv =

    18
     1

% e) A*B
AB = A * B % AB is the product of A and B matrice, Solution to part e

AB =

    13    -6
     2     4

% f) B*A
BA = B * A % AB is the product of A and B matrice, Solution to part f

BA =

    10    -3
    -2     7


% g) A^2
AA = A * A % AA is the A^2, Solution to part g

AA =

    88   -36
    48    -8

% h) By = w

y = B\w % y is the vector such that B*y = w, Solution to part h
